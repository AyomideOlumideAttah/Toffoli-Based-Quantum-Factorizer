# Toffoli-Based-Quantum-Factorizer
An exhibition of a quantum circuit for efficiently factorizing integers (using Shor's Algorithm), where the essential component of the circuit, the modular exponentiation circuit, was built entirely out of Toffoli and Toffoli-like gates. This project was built as a part of the 2025 BeyondQuantum Research experience.
